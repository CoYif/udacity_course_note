// This is the beginning of real ultilizing git jourey 
// First commond will initilise the current folder as a repository 
git init 

// Check current dirtory files status 
git status

// Add the files to the staging aread before commit
git add . (It will add all the files under this folder)

git add file1 (It will add only the file1 to the staging area)

// Check the file's modification between working directory and staged area
git diff 

// Check the difference between staged area and repository
git diff --staged

// Reset all the changes made in staged area and working directory
git reset hard (It'll reset all the changes made in both working directory and staged area)

// E.g. you have commit "a1" -> "a2" -> "a3" -> "a4"
git checkout "a2"
// You made some changes, then commit
git commit "b1"
git checkout master 
git log 
// You'll not see the commit "b1" you just made. becaue it's not in the master branch
// You should do this
git checkout "b1"
git checkout -b New_Branch_Name (This commond is equivalent to "git branch New_Branch_Name", then "git checkout New_Branch_Name)
// When you run that commond, you must in that commit "b1" position
